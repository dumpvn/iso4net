# ISO4Net

ISO4Net is a .NET library used to handle Financial messages based  on the ISO8583 standard. It's currently a 
work in progress and this documentation will be updated shortly.

Currently, only ISO8583 '87 messages are supported in ASCII format, but soon will add support for BCD and ISO '93.
Check Test example to get an idea of how it works.
